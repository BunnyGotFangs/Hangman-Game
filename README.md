JavaScript Assignment - Homework3 - Hangman Game


WHAT THE PROJECT DOES:

Horsey Hangman is built withjavascipt. the basic premise is the computer will randomly select words found or used in the Equine world today. The player will have 6 attempts to guess the word, but selecting one letter at a time on their keyboard. Correct guess will display letters in the word and incorrect guess will result in one step closer to "game over".

Images help to assist in the recall of the words and incorrect letters are showed to help in making more accurate guesses.

the game will keep score of the wind and losses in the players round and will reveal the word with an alert at the end no matter if one or loss.


WHY IT IS USEFUL:

Horsey Hangman is a game of skill and knowledge and flat out luck. It is designed to support up and coming Equine enthusiast around the world, but helping in them to identify and recall important terms and phrases that they will learn throughout their Equine journey.
